# Maze
Maze World Algorithm Simulator! This program provides an interactive environment for exploring various pathfinding algorithms in maze-like environments. Using this simulator, you can visualize how algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and A* Search work in finding paths from a starting point to a goal within a maze
